# Module 4 Solutions

For this homework, you will need the following datasets:
* [Green Taxi dataset (2019 and 2020)](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/tag/green)
* [Yellow Taxi dataset (2019 and 2020)](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/tag/yellow)
* [For Hire Vehicle dataset (2019)](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/tag/fhv)

For ingesting the data the [web_to_gcs.py](code/web_to_gcs.py)-script is used.


## Before you start

1. Make sure you, **at least**, have them in GCS with a External Table **OR** a Native Table - use whichever method you prefer to accomplish that (Workflow Orchestration with [pandas-gbq](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/samples/bigquery-pandas-gbq-to-gbq-simple), [dlt for gcs](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/destinations/filesystem), [dlt for BigQuery](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/destinations/bigquery), [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil), etc)
2. You should have exactly `7,778,101` records in your Green Taxi table
3. You should have exactly `109,047,518` records in your Yellow Taxi table
4. You should have exactly `43,244,696` records in your FHV table
5. Build the staging models for green/yellow as shown in [here](./code/taxi_rides_ny/models/staging/)
   Commands for creating green and yellow staging models:
   ```bash
   # Seed the Taxi Lookup Table
   dbt seed --select taxi_zone_lookup --profile=bq-dbt-workshop
 
   # Build the staging model of the green taxi data
   dbt build --select stg_green_tripdata --vars '{'is_test_run': 'false'}' --profile=bq-dbt-workshop
 
   # Build the staging model of the yellow taxi data
   dbt build --select stg_yellow_tripdata --vars '{'is_test_run': 'false'}' --profile=bq-dbt-workshop
   ```

6. Build the dimension/fact for taxi_trips joining with `dim_zones`  as shown in [here](./code/taxi_rides_ny/models/core/fact_trips.sql)
   ```bash
   dbt build --select dim_zones --vars '{'is_test_run': 'false'}' --profile=bq-dbt-workshop
   dbt build --select fact_trips --vars '{'is_test_run': 'false'}' --profile=bq-dbt-workshop
   ```



Create the dataset `trips_data_all` in BigQuery in your GCP project. And use the following sql commands to create external tables and / or materialized tables: [create_tables.sql](create_tables.sql)



## Question 1: Understanding dbt model resolution

Provided you've got the following sources.yaml
```yaml
version: 2

sources:
  - name: raw_nyc_tripdata
    database: "{{ env_var('DBT_BIGQUERY_PROJECT', 'dtc_zoomcamp_2025') }}"
    schema:   "{{ env_var('DBT_BIGQUERY_SOURCE_DATASET', 'raw_nyc_tripdata') }}"
    tables:
      - name: ext_green_taxi
      - name: ext_yellow_taxi
```

with the following env variables setup where `dbt` runs:
```shell
export DBT_BIGQUERY_PROJECT=myproject
export DBT_BIGQUERY_DATASET=my_nyc_tripdata
```

What does this .sql model compile to?
```sql
select * 
from {{ source('raw_nyc_tripdata', 'ext_green_taxi' ) }}
```

- `select * from dtc_zoomcamp_2025.raw_nyc_tripdata.ext_green_taxi`
- `select * from dtc_zoomcamp_2025.my_nyc_tripdata.ext_green_taxi`
- `select * from myproject.raw_nyc_tripdata.ext_green_taxi`
- `select * from myproject.my_nyc_tripdata.ext_green_taxi`
- `select * from dtc_zoomcamp_2025.raw_nyc_tripdata.green_taxi`


### Answer 1

- `select * from myproject.my_nyc_tripdata.ext_green_taxi`

Steps taken to get the answer:
- The `DBT_BIGQUERY_PROJECT` is set to `myproject`
- The `DBT_BIGQUERY_DATASET` is set to `my_nyc_tripdata`
- Project-name and schema are obtained from the `sources.yaml` with `raw_nyc_tripdata`
- The table in the source `raw_nyc_tripdata` is set to `ext_green_taxi`
- Constructed `source('raw_nyc_tripdata', 'ext_green_taxi' )` composes to `myproject.my_nyc_tripdata.ext_green_taxi`



## Question 2: dbt Variables & Dynamic Models

Say you have to modify the following dbt_model (`fct_recent_taxi_trips.sql`) to enable Analytics Engineers to dynamically control the date range. 

- In development, you want to process only **the last 7 days of trips**
- In production, you need to process **the last 30 days** for analytics

```sql
select *
from {{ ref('fact_taxi_trips') }}
where pickup_datetime >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30' DAY
```

What would you change to accomplish that in a such way that command line arguments takes precedence over ENV_VARs, which takes precedence over DEFAULT value?

- Add `ORDER BY pickup_datetime DESC` and `LIMIT {{ var("days_back", 30) }}`
- Update the WHERE clause to `pickup_datetime >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '{{ var("days_back", 30) }}' DAY`
- Update the WHERE clause to `pickup_datetime >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '{{ env_var("DAYS_BACK", "30") }}' DAY`
- Update the WHERE clause to `pickup_datetime >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '{{ var("days_back", env_var("DAYS_BACK", "30")) }}' DAY`
- Update the WHERE clause to `pickup_datetime >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '{{ env_var("DAYS_BACK", var("days_back", "30")) }}' DAY`


### Answer 2

- Update the WHERE clause to `pickup_datetime >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '{{ var("days_back", env_var("DAYS_BACK", "30")) }}' DAY`



## Question 3: dbt Data Lineage and Execution

Considering the data lineage below **and** that taxi_zone_lookup is the **only** materialization build (from a .csv seed file):

![image](./homework_q2.png)

Select the option that does **NOT** apply for materializing `fct_taxi_monthly_zone_revenue`:

- `dbt run`
- `dbt run --select +models/core/dim_taxi_trips.sql+ --target prod`
- `dbt run --select +models/core/fct_taxi_monthly_zone_revenue.sql`
- `dbt run --select +models/core/`
- `dbt run --select models/staging/+`


### Answer 3

- `dbt run --select +models/core/`

The command builds only the core models and their upstream dependencies due to the `+` at the model name



## Question 4: dbt Macros and Jinja

Consider you're dealing with sensitive data (e.g.: [PII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data)), that is **only available to your team and very selected few individuals**, in the `raw layer` of your DWH (e.g: a specific BigQuery dataset or PostgreSQL schema), 

 - Among other things, you decide to obfuscate/masquerade that data through your staging models, and make it available in a different schema (a `staging layer`) for other Data/Analytics Engineers to explore

- And **optionally**, yet  another layer (`service layer`), where you'll build your dimension (`dim_`) and fact (`fct_`) tables (assuming the [Star Schema dimensional modeling](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/star-schema)) for Dashboarding and for Tech Product Owners/Managers

You decide to make a macro to wrap a logic around it:

```sql
{% macro resolve_schema_for(model_type) -%}

    {%- set target_env_var = 'DBT_BIGQUERY_TARGET_DATASET'  -%}
    {%- set stging_env_var = 'DBT_BIGQUERY_STAGING_DATASET' -%}

    {%- if model_type == 'core' -%} 
        {{- env_var(target_env_var) -}}
    {%- else -%}                    
        {{- env_var(stging_env_var, env_var(target_env_var)) -}}
    {%- endif -%}

{%- endmacro %}
```

And use on your staging, dim_ and fact_ models as:
```sql
{{ config(
    schema=resolve_schema_for('core'), 
) }}
```

That all being said, regarding macro above, **select all statements that are true to the models using it**:
- Setting a value for  `DBT_BIGQUERY_TARGET_DATASET` env var is mandatory, or it'll fail to compile
- Setting a value for `DBT_BIGQUERY_STAGING_DATASET` env var is mandatory, or it'll fail to compile
- When using `core`, it materializes in the dataset defined in `DBT_BIGQUERY_TARGET_DATASET`
- When using `stg`, it materializes in the dataset defined in `DBT_BIGQUERY_STAGING_DATASET`, or defaults to `DBT_BIGQUERY_TARGET_DATASET`
- When using `staging`, it materializes in the dataset defined in `DBT_BIGQUERY_STAGING_DATASET`, or defaults to `DBT_BIGQUERY_TARGET_DATASET`


### Answer 4
The answers are as follows
- True, False, True, True, True


## Serious SQL

Alright, in module 1, you had a SQL refresher, so now let's build on top of that with some serious SQL.

These are not meant to be easy - but they'll boost your SQL and Analytics skills to the next level.  
So, without any further do, let's get started...

You might want to add some new dimensions `year` (e.g.: 2019, 2020), `quarter` (1, 2, 3, 4), `year_quarter` (e.g.: `2019/Q1`, `2019-Q2`), and `month` (e.g.: 1, 2, ..., 12), **extracted from pickup_datetime**, to your `fct_taxi_trips` OR `dim_taxi_trips.sql` models to facilitate filtering your queries


## Question 5: Taxi Quarterly Revenue Growth

1. Create a new model `fct_taxi_trips_quarterly_revenue.sql`
2. Compute the Quarterly Revenues for each year for based on `total_amount`
3. Compute the Quarterly YoY (Year-over-Year) revenue growth 
  * e.g.: In 2020/Q1, Green Taxi had -12.34% revenue growth compared to 2019/Q1
  * e.g.: In 2020/Q4, Yellow Taxi had +34.56% revenue growth compared to 2019/Q4

Considering the YoY Growth in 2020, which were the yearly quarters with the best (or less worse) and worst results for green, and yellow

- green: {best: 2020/Q2, worst: 2020/Q1}, yellow: {best: 2020/Q2, worst: 2020/Q1}
- green: {best: 2020/Q2, worst: 2020/Q1}, yellow: {best: 2020/Q3, worst: 2020/Q4}
- green: {best: 2020/Q1, worst: 2020/Q2}, yellow: {best: 2020/Q2, worst: 2020/Q1}
- green: {best: 2020/Q1, worst: 2020/Q2}, yellow: {best: 2020/Q1, worst: 2020/Q2}
- green: {best: 2020/Q1, worst: 2020/Q2}, yellow: {best: 2020/Q3, worst: 2020/Q4}
