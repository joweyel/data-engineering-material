        "What is dlt?\n",
        "\n",
        "* dlt is an open-source library that you can add to your Python scripts to load data from various and often messy data sources into well-structured, live datasets.\n",
        "* You can install it using pip and there's no need to start any backends or containers. You can simply import dlt in your Python script and write a simple pipeline to load data from sources like APIs, databases, files, etc. into a destination of your choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are a few reasons why you should use dlt:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Automated maintenance: With schema inference and evolution and alerts, and with short declarative code, maintenance becomes simple.\n",
        "* Run it where Python runs: You can use dlt on Airflow, serverless functions, notebooks. It doesn't require external APIs, backends or containers, and scales on both micro and large infrastructures.\n",
        "* User-friendly, declarative interface: dlt provides a user-friendly interface that removes knowledge obstacles for beginners while empowering senior professionals.\n",
        "\n",
        "Benefits: As a data engineer, dlt offers several benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Efficient Data Extraction and Loading: dlt simplifies the process of extracting and loading data. It allows you to decorate your data-producing functions with loading or incremental extraction metadata, enabling dlt to extract and load data according to your custom logic. This is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets, as dlt supports scalability through iterators, chunking, and parallelization. Read more\n",
        "\n",
        "* Automated Schema Management: dlt automatically infers a schema from data and loads the data to the destination. It can easily adapt and structure data as it evolves, reducing the time spent on maintenance and development. This ensures data consistency and quality. Read more\n",
        "* Data Governance Support: dlt pipelines offer robust governance support through pipeline metadata utilization, schema enforcement and curation, and schema change alerts. This promotes data consistency, traceability, and control throughout the data processing lifecycle. Read more\n",
        "\n",
        "* Flexibility and Scalability: dlt can be used on Airflow, serverless functions, notebooks, and scales on both micro and large infrastructures. It also offers several mechanisms and configuration options to scale up and fine-tune pipelines. Read more\n",
        "\n",
        "* Post-Loading Transformations: dlt provides several options for transformations after loading the data, including using dbt, the dlt SQL client, or Pandas. This allows you to shape and manipulate the data before or after loading it, allowing you to meet specific requirements and ensure data quality and consistency. Read more\n",
